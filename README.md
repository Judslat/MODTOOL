# MODTOOL

This is my collection of all the Modding tools that are used with the DJI range of units

Just run the setup file and it will download the tool from dropbox and create a shortcut on your
desktop, this tool is the only one that has all the needed files and are the originals so many
thanks to all those who built the tools

I have made the Deejayeye modder tool easier to use as it auto elevates the command prompt, if it hangs
just close it out and restart it.

Some tools will auto update on first use

DankDroneDownloader Tool,DeeJayEYE Modder tool,NLD,Dumldore,
DJI Super Patcher,Silencio,JKSon FCC MOD,
The file is to big for Github to host so I have uploaded
it to dropbox, just run the "RUN.BAT file and this will
download the tool and start the installer
Thanks to all the OG's for the files, ive not made any changes to any
of them except for Bin4ry modder tool to which he agreed, changes include 
an auto admin elevation and a request to choose which version you want, also includes all the tools

All tools are owned by their respective creators, I have just assembled them 
into one easy to use interface
